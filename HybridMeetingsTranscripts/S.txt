

Yeah. OK. So the recording has
been started and.

So as I as I already mentioned the hybrid meetings and clause ahead and ask the first would be how often do you meetings and what is your usual sense are you a contributor? Are another role?

So I would say I participate.

Gradually, in this hybrid OK.

Now a bit more often.

By the fact that I am working
more often with a team member.

Shoulder to shoulder recently. Mm hmm. OK.

And.

I'm more listener or I. Just make.

Intervention in cases strictly
required.

Uh, huh. OK.

OK, then how do you prepare for does your preparation differ Meaning, like completely on site any difference in the hybrid meetings and? No, no, no. I will say there is
no difference.

OK, OK, sure. Then have you remote and onsite participants Do you do you find like a like a
collaboration difference?

Hmm. Like personally, if you may. I I believe that when you are on
site in this ebrid.

If you are not.

The main speaker from the.

This on site group of people. I more always inner than actively OK.

OK. So OK, so like is, is there Yeah.

you are attending a hybrid or the?

Remote ones.

Oh, sorry I didn't get the So so to come back the question, difference if you attend?

Completely onsite or completely the hybrid meetings?

Hmm, yeah, for sure there is a
slight little difference.

OK, OK, sure.

Like in your experience, do as much as though who are on on
site in the hybrid meetings?

Yeah, I believe they they people on site. OK, OK, wow. Yeah.

And how do you perceive the participants in comparison to said that they they contribute more do do you have something to
more elaborate about it?

So I believe that when connected.

If they're really focused on the they tend to participate.

More than people, that is sort side if you understand what I.

OK, OK. Will to say, yeah.

OK.

Have you observed any biases or participants? Do you think that some guys are collaborating in they may have a good think that there may be a bias perceptions which you feel about
them or they feel about you?

Oh.

Yeah, so I think.

That when people of this subteam to agree more between them self.

OK, OK. So the opinions they have or the between them compared.

Of to other participants from Mm hmm. Mm hmm mm hmm.

OK. that when you are fully remote, opinion.

Mm hmm.

But in the moment you you
gathering this on site group.

Then you tend to be more agree
inside. This sub team would say.

OK, OK, sounds sounds good. How do you think like these
dynamics?

The the one which you talked of the team. (...)

I don't think there is big
impact.

Yeah. Not nothing that I want, I
would say.

OK.

And do you have a feeling that there is a group formation like
a social group formations?

Yeah, yeah, this definitely. OK. And if if if that is can you that do you have the reasons for reasons that why such kind of
social groups are formed?

No, but I I believe it's just you are.

Physically next to.

The other team member you. Uh.

You feel that you have more other place remotely. OK. And do you think that?

The cultural or the linguistic national team so we have cross cultural or the linguistic Yeah.

it matter or do you think that formation?

No, no, no, no this no. OK. OK. So so if if there is, if similarities between one group
so.

It is not important that the them if they are working on
site.

No, I believe it's not a problem OK, OK, OK. OK, fine. Another
part is like the tools.

Like what it it's about tools what? Which tools do you use to collaboration in hybrid
meetings?

Tools can be anything. For teams. That's a tool. Then we Yeah.

when we have like.

PR code.

Sorry, what? Pair programming they take notes or something, so do you use any tools for more during the hybrid meetings?

We use this speaker.

Uh, huh. OK.

So we don't need to put headsets OK, OK. (...)

I believe this is sort of Uh huh.

can get some echo or you know Oh, OK. Mm hmm. Mm hmm mm hmm. speaker, so it's not perfectly OK, OK. You can't share your screen you're remotely.

OK, so so so the. So.

Yeah. Overall, I would say that.

The technical tools at this are on on site is more an
impediment than.

Easier.

OK. OK. OK.

And.

Sorry, sorry for the call.

How? How do you? What is the
sorry? How does the experience?

Sorry, what is the experience?

How does the experience of to being physically present in
the meeting according to you?

Hmm. Uh, sorry. Could you Like would you like to know? Yeah, sure.

In in general or more in detail Yeah, I mean, I mean.

How is the experience like we teams, right? So how is the teams?

In compared to having like a experience, the comparison of Oh, I think it's much better.

Because with teams. With the with that OK with the With remote using teams, because Mm hmm.

example, I can mute myself if if OK, OK. Yeah. on site, everybody will be Yeah, yeah. if I have to calf and I am to I Mm hmm.

But on the other side, for sometimes.

When we connect remotely.

There is.

Shared office room so you could belonging to the company, but OK.

eventually he has very deep this noise cancelling tool.

And. Easily. Is it disturbing the notice this phenomena.

But sometimes we hear.

Noise from other colleagues that Mm hmm mm hmm.

OK. Wanted and I believe we should some sense she'll find solution
to improve this.

Have any suggestions?

I don't know if we can improve office will be ideal.

But I believe it will.

Not be implemented because of
course company.

Will not support this for some
cost reason.

So I probably some more Mm hmm. OK. need to be explored.

OK. Yeah.

OK, so do you do which form of
meeting do you find suitable?

On site, hybrid or completely
remote?

For me, completely remote will OK. (...)

OK. Yeah, because of a kind of, Technical issue.

independence. And yeah, yeah. Yeah, and focus and everything, you know.

And all on site. I believe for OK. (...)

wouldn't enjoy some completely own.

Device usually where I can.

Type or check or. Yeah, exactly. am on site.

I.

I found it difficult to join the some poor request or some.

Information that I need.

OK. OK. OK. Yeah.

Then yeah. Then that's it. OK.

Mm hmm. Not the interviewer discussion, Mm hmm.

OK.
